## Introduction
Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin â€” the pigment that gives your skin its color.
Although the exact cause of Melanoma isn't clear, the risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. 
Knowing the warning signs of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. 
Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is detected early.

## Objective
The goal is to support research and development of algorithms for automated diagnosis of melanoma, the most lethal skin cancer (Noel C.F. Codella et al 2017).
